# AutomatedTollBooth
Our implementation of the project 'Automated toll booth simulator' is as follows:
We ask the user to enter the details of the vehicle (through buttons on our GUI) to calculate the
toll fee appropriately. We register the license plate to our database if it does not exist. If the
license no. exists, we deduct the balance from the money the user has stored in his account.
The gate is opened, the vehicle may proceed. The gate remains closed if the toll fee is not paid.
We are planning on using Python as our front-end (GUI) platform. We shall use MySQL to store
user details in a database.
Firstly, simulation is one of the most useful and powerful applications of computers. Through
some rather simple and straightforward simulations, we can obtain a very accurate
approximation to complicated situations. Secondly, toll booths promote contact less payment.
